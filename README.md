# Property Listing CorDapp - Queryable States

Property Listing CorDapp provides the property owner with a functionality to upload the details(address, area, selling price) of the property that he wants to sell.
A potential buyer node uses a **_pull mechanism_** to request other nodes in the network for a list of houses/properties that the node has. 
In this example, we are storing all properties returned by the sender node however, this pull mechanism allows the buyer node to decide what they want to store in the vault after verifying the properties shared by the sender node. 


This CorDapp illustrates the power of an RDBMS running on a distributed ledger.
By letting the ContractState implement the **_QueryableState_** interface, a Corda nodeâ€™s vault can become SQL queryable with any JDBC friendly database in the world.

The Property Listing CorDapp provides examples of querying the vault based on State attributes via both the **_ServiceHub_** and **_CordaRPCOps_**.
